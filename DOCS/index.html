          RPCView is a Windows application designed to simplify
          management of remote procedures of
          Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA).<br>
          <p>With RPCView, users can:
          <ul>
              <li> View and modify the definitions of
                remote procedures (file #8994)
              <li> Register remote procedures in application contexts.
              <li> Execute remote procedures.
          </ul>
          <p>Installation of custom RPC makes possible to review and edit RPC implementation.

          <p>
            RPCView requires the XWB and FMDC packages to be installed on the server.
          <p>
            The application is designed to work in Cache, YottaDB, and GT.M environments,
            and to connect to VistA instances that use hash tables "VistA", "VistA Demo" and "OSHERA".

<p>
The application enables the user to view and modify the data
on both server and client machines. However, the user should remember that changes to the RPC
may affect applications that use the RPC. Errors in descriptor can make RPC unusable.
<p>
To prevent any damage to your important data, please test the application
on a non-production DB instance first and make sure it is compatible
with your server software version before accessing any critical data.
<p>
Please note that the application is provided <strong>"AS IS" WITH NO WARRANTIES</strong>
and the author is not responsible for any data loss or damage
that may occur as a result of using this application.
